# Kernel build script for Asus Zenwatch3 (swift)

This script allows you to compile the kernel of the Asus Zenwatch3 easily. You only need to download the current kernel sources from the [Asus support website](https://www.asus.com/ZenWatch/ASUS-ZenWatch-3-WI503Q/HelpDesk_Download/) and place it into this clone directory, as well as point the `OMNI_TREE` variable in the `build.sh` to the path of your OmniRom source tree (needed for the gcc-4.8 toolchain).
It then automatically extracts the archive, patches the Makefile [with a fix from T10NAZ](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=65954322&postcount=5) *(thanks!)* and then compiles the kernel.
